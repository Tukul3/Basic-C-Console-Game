# Basic-C-Console-Game
This mini project has been written as part of a small school project and a proof of concept of how to implement the skeleton of such an idea which can later be improved upon.

The code uses a level defined in the levels.txt, if you wish to change the structure of a level make sure to write in 3 lines containing 25 characters of "'.' , 'a' , 'y' ".
The "." in level means passable tile, "y" unpassable and "a" level exit.

A lot of the stuff in the code has been hardcoded which by itself is bad but I have made this just a proof of concept, something which I'd like to expand upon and add many new features in Python or C++.
